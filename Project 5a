#MAPPER

import sys
import string

def mapper():
    '''
    In this exercise, we want to sum up all the values in the ENTRIEsn_hourly column in the 
    turnstile_weather.csv. You can check out the csv file and its structure below:
    https://www.dropbox.com/s/meyki2wl9xfa7yk/turnstile_data_master_with_weather.csv
    
    Each line of input will look like a row from our final Subway-MTA dataset, in csv format.
    
    This mapper should
    1) return 0 as the key and
    2) the number in the ENTRIEsn_hourly column as the value
    3)  The key and the count should be separated by a tab
        for example: 0\t12345

    Example output to the reducer would look like this:
    0   10501050105010.0
    '''
    header = True
    for line in sys.stdin:
    	# your code here
        if header:
            header = False
        else:
            data = line.strip().split(",")
            print "{0}\t{1}".format(0,data[6])
      
mapper()

#REDUCER

import sys
import string

def reducer():
    '''
    Given the output of the mapper for this assignment, simply print
    0 and then the average number of riders per day for the month of 05/2011,
    separated by a tab.
    
    There are 31 days in 05/2011.
    
    Example output might look like this:
    0   10501050.0
    '''
    riders = 0.0    
    old_key = None
    header = True
    for line in sys.stdin:
        if header:
            header = False
        else:
             riders+= float(line.split('\t')[1])
    print '{0}\t{1}'.format(0, riders/31)
    
reducer()
